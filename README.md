## Problem Statment:
This project involves analysing ultra marathon race data to gain insights into various factors influencing athlete performance. <br /> 
The dataset includes information on race events, athlete demographics, and performance metrics. <br />
The goal is to understand trends and patterns in the data and visualise these insights effectively. <br />


## Steps Followed:
### 1.Data Preprocessing: <br />
- Imported libraries
- Loaded data
- Obtained data details
### 2. Data Cleaning: <br />
- Filtered events to include only those from the year 2020 in the USA, with event distances of 50 km or 50 miles.
- Removed 'USA' from the event name.
- Cleaned up athlete age data.
- Removed 'h' from athlete performance metrics.
- Cleaned up null values.
- Checked for duplicates.
- Reset index.
- Fixed data types.
- Renamed columns for clarity.
- Removed unnecessary columns.
### 3. Data Finalisation: <br />
- Reordered columns and saved the refined and cleaned data as `df3` (a more refined and cleaned version than `df` and `df2`).
- Converted this large dataset into a simplified version with the following columns as per requirement:
  - `year`: Year of the race
  - `race_day`: Day of the race
  - `race_name`: Name of the race
  - `race_length`: Length of the race
  - `race_number_of_finishers`: Number of finishers in the race
  - `athlete_performance`: Performance metrics of the athlete
  - `athlete_gender`: Gender of the athlete
  - `athlete_average_speed`: Average speed of the athlete (in miles per hour)
  - `athlete_id`: Unique identifier for the athlete
  - `athlete_age`: Age of the athlete

### 4. Data Visualisation and Key Insights <br />
